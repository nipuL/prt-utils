.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpkgfoster\fP is a simple script you can use to clean up orphaned packages (i.e. 
packages which no other package depends on). It uses prt-cache by default, so 
remember to build the cache with "prt-get cache". You can also use normal 
prt-get by modifying the PRT_GET variable. List of packages to keep 
are stored in ~/.keepers. Packages from the core collection are never considered for 
deletion.
